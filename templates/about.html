        <h4>Who is Len Guff?</h4>
            <p>Len Guff was just like you. Just trying to get by in the business world. Earning a crust in
                the everyday office bants, high-fiving the right people, firmly-handshaking the old firm, 
                mingling at huddles, turning out logs at fireside chats, listening to energetic entrepreneurs 
                pass out PowerPoint pearls at public, publicity, press and PR talks. </p>
            <p>But something was grinding away at Guff. These people who claim to have the keys at the 
                keynotes, were pedalling nonsense. No-one from the breakout room to the power breakfast 
                buffet table was making any sense.</p>
            <p>They were just words, words that sounded right, words that fitted into a soundbite. 
                Phrases which were repeated because they encapsulated an idea or appeared to codify a new 
                approach. But under closer scrutiny they signified nothing. These were the entrepreneur’s new 
                clothes and Guff had had enough.</p>
            <p>So Len started to tap these business catchphrases and cliches into his phone. And he began to 
                pick them apart, to understand where they came from and to suggest how they could be made 
                better or binned. The result was an ebook which is 
                <a href="https://leanpub.com/jargonunchained" target="_blank">still widely available.</a></p>
            <p>Now it’s time to align with a new paradigm. To truly digitise and digitalise. 
                The website is no longer about Len Guff. This website is about all of us. So the next time 
                someone throws out an empty phrase in the boardroom or the ten-minute standup - it’s time to 
                figuratively make a stand.  </p>
            <p>Put it on this site, so through extended ranting, we can make it better. And who knows if we 
                get enough momentum, traction or velocity (or, you know, words) we could turn out a new ebook. 
                Written by all of us. Because we are all Len Guff. </p>
